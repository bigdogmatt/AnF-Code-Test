When reviewing a project like this, I tend to look for a few general things first:
1. Consistency (Confirmed)
2. Build Success (Confirmed)
3. Basic familiarity with Android concepts (Confirmed)

After the initial look through, I tend to do a deeper dive into where things can be improved.  
I look for the following:  
1. Unnecessary code that can be removed.
2. Defensive coding that is needed.
3. Error handling
4. Separation of Concerns

I have made some notes in the different components and have provided some helpful links where appropriate.
